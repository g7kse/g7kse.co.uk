Ok, so its not 2025 yet, I'm just keen alright . [Fabian Kurz, DJ5CW](https://fkurz.net/ham/52week-challenge) produced a 52 week ham challenge, well wrth looking at for a bit of fun throughout the year.

So, to start things off, I'll say what I'm doing the week of that particular challenge and then during the week add in the next one. I'll start with the first one :grinning:
