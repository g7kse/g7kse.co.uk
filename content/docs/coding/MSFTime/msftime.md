Ok, so this one is a bit more niche. The Anthorn time signal is transmitted on 60kHz. Every now and again receiver modules pop up mine came from [PV Electronics](https://www.pvelectronics.co.uk/) but stock comes in and out. Because it's VLF its got my attention, so you may have to juggle about a bit to find one, or make your own. Its been a while since I did this project so the best solution is to follow th eoriginal project and code on [Dances With Ferrets](http://danceswithferrets.org/geekblog/?p=44) website.

Otherwise feast your eyes on this amazingly produced vid.
