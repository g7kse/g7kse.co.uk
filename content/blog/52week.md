Rather than have 1 post per week, I will be posting a weekly update on my progress in the 52 Week Challenge.

#### Week 1 - Design a QSL card

Job done. The QSL card on the front page is mine...ordered some and so I'll have to use them now. The JoyPlot is the bit I'm keen on as it comes from the Joy Division album [Unknown Pleasures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures) which was done by [Peter Saville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Saville_(designer)). There's a subtle red dot for the QTH and the font is [Acid](https://www.dafont.com/acid.font) and the logo's were just turned into single colour ones as opposed to multiple colours.

#### Week 2 - NCDXF Beacon Listening

Another successful week. I hooked up the IC7300 to Mrs G7KSE's laptop (she wasn't impressed) to [Faros](https://www.dxatlas.com/Faros/) and let it do it's thing with the attic antennas. None of which are ideal for beacon monitoring. However the results were really surprising. Stuff that I thought I wouldn't hear came through quite clear. A typical plot is below

#### Week 3 - Make a contact with a different continent on 80m or 160m

This is going to be hard. Not because of anything weird, just I don't have an 80m or 160m antenna. More to follow...
