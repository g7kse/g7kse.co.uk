Rather than have 1 post per week, I will be posting a weekly update on my progress in the 52 Week Challenge.

#### Week 1 - Implement a backup to my ham radio log

This should be pretty straightforward. I use [QLog](https://github.com/foldynl/QLog) for my logging and thats probably the most important thing for me...but I also partcipate in [SOTA](https://sota.org) and [WOTA](https://wota.org.uk) as weel as the odd contest. This should all be in one place so its easy to handle. I have done a backup of the data as it currently is and downloaded my various contest logs (I'm trying out [Not1mm](https://github.com/mbridak/not1mm) for contests). The data all goes onto a folder on my hard drive and it is backed up to my Synology NAS and Dropbox. That should cover it.....unless it should all be automated :smile:

#### Week 2 - TBD
