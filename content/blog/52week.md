Rather than have 1 post per week, I will be posting a weekly update on my progress in the 52 Week Challenge.

#### Week 1 (task 46) - Write a useful computer programnme

Well this wasn't going to be my first choice of task, but I decided to go with it. I have been wanting to have a play at coding using python and have nicked / collated a few scripts together in a repository. Some stuff just isn't working for me so I thought I'd back off off a bit and do something that wouldn't be too taxing but might be useful. So the radom-o-matic application was born. It takes the ham challenge task and randomly picks one from the list and allows you to 'accept'the challenge or 'reject' the challenge. If you accept it, you do it and it *shouldn't* pick that one again. If you reject it is give you another one.

I used CustomTKinter for the GUI and it was a bit of a learning curve but I got there in the end. I had to use a bit of coding AI to get the GUI to work but Here it is in all its glory...ready to be used or not :-) either way it could be improved I'm sure as part of a different task

The code is in this Repo. If you want to help me understand how to make some of my other stuff work better then I'm open to offers. Particularly the HamTools stuff.
